Note - some PET images are too large to upload. However, all are available at Justine Hansen's repository: https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors/tree/main. Moreover, the dataframe of all the data to input is also too big - should you want this data, please reach out to danielle.kurtin18@imperial.ac.uk.
